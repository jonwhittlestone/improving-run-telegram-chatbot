# Improving Run Telegram Chat bot #

This script retrieves my latest running time for my Denbies running route from the mapmyrun API and adds to a Google Sheet.

An entry on a chart is made and the trend line updated.

The script can be part of a flask service.

The script can be initiated via Telegram chat bot and the user is returned a chart.
